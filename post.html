                    A valuable cell article that can cover many historical details of the hilly Dumbara area is located near the city of Madawala, Kandy. Preserved as a valuable artifact by the Department of Archeology, it is named as "Madawala Giri Letter" and according to the date of writing, 556 years have passed.
                    As mentioned and identified in the article, it belongs to the sixth Parakramabahu reign (around 1459 AD). This Giri letter can be seen when you get off from Madawala town and take a side road about 500 meters on the highway from Kandy to Wattegama. Although the Dumbara area belonging to an old kingdom was in a high state of historical value, there are very few sources with corroborating information.
                    Therefore, the giri letter named Madawala is the most valuable object to reveal the information of the Dumbara region at that time and through this giri letter, it is a great source for the study of facts about the agricultural society, economic affairs and language, literature and spellings of the upland area during that kingdom, but this giri letter is an unknown source.
                    "Let's sit on Apana and Jyoti. In the forty-sixth year of the coming of the Lord Sri Parakramabahu Chakkavarthy, the land of the mud in the mud of the village plan of Dumbara Bada and the land of the village and the trees and leaves of the village shall be given to Achari Paramana of Siddaulla and his son Suriya as long as the sun and the moon exist. In the future, the King, Viceroy, Chief Minister, etc. cannot make any objections to this.
                    In front of Dantotawathure Dewan and Diwanawatte Sri Lankan authorities, this inscription was written in the center of Divelpatkada Dumbara Agampadi Dasa Dena" This is the content of the Madawala cell letter and the above inscription was set up in the village of Madawala on the Katugastota Wattegama road in Kandy.
                    This letter consists of 21 lines in round Sinhala script and is written on a set granite background. The letter has nine signs in three places and a commentary on this in the second category of the Epigraphia Thessalonica collection by H.W. Provided by Mr. Codrington. It is easy to recognize the sun, moon, crow and dog figures among the several signs there.
                    Other marks indicated by Mr. Codrington are sets of hammer, dagger, and tongs. In one of these, the moon, the sun and the hammer and the lance are recorded. Elsewhere hammer, dagger and tongs are recorded. Hammer, dagger and tongs are the symbols of the grade of metalworking. The two signs of the moon and the sun mean that the sun and the moon are present. It is also mentioned in the article.
                    Two dog-crow figures mean that if the property is acquired by someone else, the dog-crow will be born in the second soul. There are several personal names in the article and they are the names of Sirisangabo, Sri Parakramabahu, Jyoti, Paramhana, Suriya, Dewan and Ceylon authorities. There are several titles here and they are Appana (Apa), Sitana, Raja, Yuvaraja, Maha Minister and Agampadi. Achari refers to Shernia.
                    Dumbara, Madawala, Siddaulla, Dantotawathure, Diwanawatta are the place names that come here and the words village plan and Divelpatkada are two words that deserve special attention. 'Dumbara' is here in Depolaka as 'Dumavara'. All the place names here are still in use today around Kandy and Dumbara is a wide area. The mudflats are still there today. Siddavulla may be Udunuvara Siddavulla.
                    Divanawatta is located near Batugoda in Harispattu. Dantotawatura may be the name of Dantotawatura in the book. That is, this can be in the underlying tooth. According to the content of this historical document, the giving of a royal grant, those who received it, those who signed it, those who were witnesses and those who were in defense are also revealed, and Professor Mandis Rohanadeera Surin as well as H.W. Mr Codrington has also been identified.
                    Also, the signatories 'Apana and Jyothisitana' have been well described by Professor Mandis Rohanadirayan and it can be seen from the names of Apana and Jyothia Sitana in this article that even though King Parakramabahu the sixth reigned in Kotte, the upland areas were supervised by his superiors.
                    Also, according to the testimony of Dantotawathura Dewan and Divanawatte Ceylon authorities, the area of six paddy fields and other crops has been assigned to Siddavulla Achari Paramana and his son from the Madawala village plan. Although the king was not here, it was confirmed by the two officers mentioned above. All this happened under the supervision of the ten Dumbara Agampadis as mentioned in this article.
                    Who is Agampadi? There are various factors related to these people, most of which H.A.P. Abhayawardena Surihu has published his 'Kadaimpot' investigation in the book. It implies that there were Agampadi soldiers in the troops belonging to the government army, and if that is the case, "Dumbara Agampadi Dasa Dena" mentioned in Madawala's article means that Dumbara had those ten soldiers.
                    It is also appropriate to examine the special word 'Divel Pankada' mentioned in this article and according to Sri Sumangala Sinhala Dictionary it means Paraveni land given for a inheritance. According to Prof. Sirimal Ranavella Surin, Divel means Boga Grama, the villages that are assigned to government employees for their mission to earn their living.
                    Sirimal Ranawella has mentioned in his dictionary of Sinhala inscriptions that Divelpatkada is the document about the grant of Divel. According to these facts, the duties of Siddavulla Achari Paramana and his son Suriya mentioned in the Madawala letter

                    In February 1948, Karolis Appuhami of Suraweera, who was clearing land in a remote village called Panakaduwa, felt something unfamiliar hit his hoe. When he found out what this was, he found three plates. Appuhami took this to his home because he thought that these plates had some value. When I went to the house and snorted and removed the oxide film that was attached to the plates, I was able to see that an unknown language was written on it. But some letters can be read. By this time Appuhami had received a treasure as it was spread throughout the village, so most of the village gathered around Appuhami's house.
                    Mr. Veda of Kopparakotua, a scholar in the village, also checked this. The villagers said that the names engraved on these plates were mantras. However, Appuhami wanted to know if there was any gold here. Therefore, he cut a small part from a corner of a plate and went to a gold factory in Akuras and after checking it, it was revealed that there is no gold here, only copper. This dashed all Appuhami's hopes.
                    Appuhami thought that these plates had no value, wrapped the three plates in a pillow case and put them in a bag. After some time, Appuhami became seriously ill and the family also faced many problems. The people in the village said that all this happened because of pieces of plates. Therefore, Appuhami gave these three pieces of plates to monk Saranapala of Molokgamu, who was the head of the temple of Chethiyakandararama in Bengamu. After some time, the police came to Appuhami's house, so they could not imagine what was happening. They were accompanied by the Commissioner of Archaeology, Mr. Senarath Paranavithana. He came there and explained that the copper sannasa found by Appuhami is of great value, and that this is a sannasa inscribed by King Vijayabahu the Great as a gift to a soldier who had adopted him as a child. As this was found in Panakaduwa village, it was named as Panakaduwa Tamba Sannasa.
                    The length of this sannas is 1 foot and two and a half inches. The width is 3 trenches and the thickness is one-eighth of a trench. Each line has seven lines of characters. King Moggallana and Queen Lokhita, who were ruling the land of Rohana, had four children: Kitti, Mahinda, Rakkhita, and Mitra. Prince Kitti was protected as a child by the general Buddharaja or Budalna. Prince Kitti, who later becomes king as Maha Vijayabahu, gathers forces from Ruhuna and expels the Cholas who were invaders at that time from the country. Panakaduwa offers copper armor to the above-mentioned general named Budalna. Sannasa is written in short in a way that evokes human emotions from the king's speech. Mr. Paranavithana says that he first met a king who mentioned himself in a document written under his command that he was a coppersmith in Panakaduwa.
                    It is mentioned in Sannas about the help Budalna gave to him; "When Ruhunu Dadanayake Sittaru Bim Budalnavan was destroyed by us and his kingdom was degraded by the power of the Tamils and he was hiding in the forest, our father Maha Swami Mughalan Rajottamaya protected the entire royal family from his people and raised us in our youth and fed us with the first fruit food. Ward away from the enemies who were looking for him and fought in many places and united the Ruhunu colony again, removed it from the forest and established it in its own kingdom.
                    This sannasa was granted to the old Budalna in AD. Must be in 1087 or so. Since then, this Sannasa is in the hands of Appuhami from a field that has passed into each other's hands after 850 years. One day some people who came to Appuhami's house were talking about the reward given to Appuhami for finding this Sannasa. When Appuhami was asked whether he would like to be given 50 acres of land or 500 rupees, Appuhami replied that he would like to receive 500 rupees. A day later D.S. Appuhami received 500 rupees from Senanayake. Despite receiving the money like this, Appuhami's family did not give up farming. Although the Panakaduwa Copper Sannasa is mentioned even in school textbooks, very few people know how this Sannasa was found. This article aims to correct that deficiency.

                Galpotha - Polonnaruwa
                stone 26 ft. 10 in. long and 4 ft. 7 in. wide with a smooth polished surface and divided into three parts. There are 24 lines in one part and 72 lines in the three parts. The stone is divided into three parts on the surface, so it looks like the pages of a book, hence this inscription is called Galpotha.
                 More than 4300 letters are found in this inscription.
                It is generally accepted that among the kings who reigned in Lanka, there is no other king who made stone inscriptions as much as King Nisshankamalla.
                 It has now been found that that king established more than seventy inscriptions throughout ancient Sri Lanka.
                 Most of the inscriptions found in the ancient ruins of Polonnaruwa belong to this king.
                Among his inscriptions the stone inscription occupies a unique place. It seems that no other inscription containing so much detail was commissioned by a king who reigned in Sri Lanka. Even the large block of rock needed to make this inscription was brought from another distant area (Sagiri). For that purpose, special forces have been used.
