                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>Sri Lanka's history of historic archival departments is deeply connected to the country's rich cultural heritage and long-standing practices of documentation and record-keeping. Ancient inscriptions, etched on stone pillars and cave walls, provide insights into the political, social, and religious aspects of ancient Sri Lankan communities. Royal archives, built by successive kings, maintain records related to government, taxation, land ownership, and other administrative affairs. Buddhist monastic libraries house important religious manuscripts, chronicles, and commentaries, offering essential historical and cultural information. During the colonial period, archive departments were developed to manage colonial records, including administrative documents, land surveys, court records, and correspondence between colonial officials. The National Archives of Sri Lanka, established in 1958, is the chief depository for government records, historical manuscripts, and other national materials, conserving Sri Lanka's documentary heritage and making it accessible to academics, scholars, and the public. Regional and institutional archives also preserve data linked to specific regions, institutions, religious organizations, and private collections, contributing to the preservation and sharing of local history and cultural assets.</p>
